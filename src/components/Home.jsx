            <p>
            Iâ€™m a 3rd year engineering student at the University of Waterloo studying Systems Design Engineering.
            I am passionate about the environment, and I want to do work to make the world a more equitable, and sustainable place. 
            I am interested in computer vision and machine learning, and I am currently seeking a co-op position for January 2024.
